# Vaping: A Sentiment Analysis of Vaping from Twitter and New York Times

### Introduction

**Vaping**, or smoking electronic cigarettes, is already a lifestyle for most of us. But, is there any health awareness remains in the society? What is exactly the internet society thinks about vaping? We are comparing sentiments between netizens of Twitter and journalists at New York Times,  to compare their opinion towards this issue.

### Methodology

We are using NRC Emotion Lexicon to determine emotions from the words used in each tweet and articles from Twitter and New York Times in the Sentiment Analysis process. 

There are 10 emotions that are going to be classified: negative, positive, fear, anger, trust, sadness, disgust, anticipation, joy, and surprise. When a word is being picked from a tweet/article, it is classified based on the entry in the lexicon. We make this classification only in English,
because it is the base language of the lexicon and it makes the result much more accurate.

After being picked, the word will be given points from the lexicon for each emotion. Higher points means the word tends to express that emotion. 
After we get the points, we sum it up from each tweet or article to reveal the general tendencies of emotions from Twitter and New York Times. [(Saif M.
